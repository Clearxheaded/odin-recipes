    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Macaroni and cheese, also known as mac and cheese, is a dish of pasta in a cheese sauce that is often baked in a casserole. 
        It is a popular comfort food in the United States and Canada.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="unordered-list">
        <li>Elbow Macaroni</li>
        <li>Butter and flour</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Paprika</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="ordered-list">
        <li><strong>Cook the macaroni.</strong> Boil the macaroni for 2 minutes less than the package instructions for al dente because they will continue to cook in the oven.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the cheese sauce</strong> Cook flour in melted butter until golden, whisk in milk or half-and-half, bring the sauce to a boil, and cook until thickened. 
            Remove from heat and whisk in shredded cheese.</li>
        <li><strong>Layer with more cheese.</strong> Pour half of the mac and cheese into a baking dish, add a layer of shredded cheese, top with the remaining mac and cheese, and finish with even more cheese. </li>
        <li><strong>Bake the mac and cheese.</strong> Bake just until bubbling around the edges and the cheese melts and turns golden-brown in spots.</li>
    </ol>
